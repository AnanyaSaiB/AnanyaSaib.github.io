Hi there, I'm Ananya, a PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/index.php), [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) working on problems in NLP and Machine Learning with the guidance of [Dr Mitesh M. Khapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/). My PhD thesis titled "Towards Better Evaluation of NLG systems" includes a survey of metrics used for various NLG tasks; their shortcomings such as susceptibility to adversarial attacks / adversarial scenarios and analysis of their formulation for caveats and biases; leveraging large-scale, task-specific pretraining for formulating more generalizable metrics for Dialogue systems that are robust to some of the synthetic perturbations; a perturbation checklist for evaluating various criteria / dimensions of multiple NLG tasks; and evaluation of multilingual models in languages beyond English (specifically Indian languages in the context of Machine Translation). I am grateful to be supported by Google PhD fellowship and Prime Minister's Fellowship for Doctoral Research. I have also worked on Reading Comprehension / QA models, Code generation, Phonetic misspellings based on inter-language interferences during my internships.<br/><br/>
My research interests include Generative AI and its Evaluation, Adversarial Attacks and Analysis, Interpretability, Human-in-the-loop techniques, Responsible AI (Fairness of models, Societal Implications, Informed usage in applications, etc), and AI for Social Good. <br/><br/>
